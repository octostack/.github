# Octostack Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaged with Internet companies
to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these
researchers and provides rewards to critical vulnerabilities.

If you've found a vulnerability, please submit it to security@octostack.io.
